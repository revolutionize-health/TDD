Proposal

- What problem does your app solve?
    Healthcare costs are unusually opaque and often inconceivably high without (and even with) insurance. In comparison to countries where the government negotiates with providers, the healthcare market in America is full of variance and patient uncertainty. It can be difficult to find out what a procedure should cost and even more difficult to find out the range of costs that may be incurred through minor discrepancies in services rendered. 
- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
    As a crowdsourcing platform, our application will allow people to know the general cost of certain medical procedures up front. In turn, this information will empower users to choose the best option, thereby promoting market competition and potentially driving down the cost of those procedures. 
- What is the mission statement?
    To empower patients to seek medical care with confidence through crowdsourced financial transparency and comparison.
